### UFO Sistings - Java Script challenge

UFO sitings is a website which filters and displays information about UFO citings from a JASON type data file, which is filtered using the following tools. 
 - HTML
 - Bootstrap
 - JavaScript
 - CSS
 - D3.js



## Working process 

UFO- level 1
  
  For this process first I used d3 to select the users input from the form. Next I used event handlers in order to identify when the button was clicked or the data on the form had been changed. On the event that the button was clicked, the data was filtered acording to the date entered by the user. Finally the the filtered data was displayed on a table using d3 to fill the data into the table.


UFO- level 2 (bonus)

  For this process I completed the same proces as in level 1, just in this case I added a dropdown menu using bootstrap, where the user could choose between different filtering options. Once an option is selected, I used if function in order to filter acordingly. 

In both levels I used CSS and Bootstrap to modify the site appearance.
